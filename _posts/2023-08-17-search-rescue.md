Similar to performing "minimally invasive surgery" on a collapsed or distressed building, snake robots can navigate through tight spaces and through narrow access points to perform search and rescue tasks. The goal of urban search and rescue (USAR) operations is to quickly and safely locate victims without disrupting the fragile state of the disaster site. Snakelike robots can locomote through rubble or tight spaces in ways that conventional robots cannot, enhancing responder's ability to locate and reach disaster victims. The robot's may also be useful in mine rescue situations where they must be deployed through small diameter access holes and locomote past obstacles within the underground environment.

**Navigate tightly packed volumes**
The robots can fit through and locomote within tightly packed volumes that may be encountered in a collapsed building or a pile of rubble.

**Deploy through a small access point**
In situations such as mine rescue operations, the responders often have a small cross-section opening through which equipment must be deployed. The snake robots can deploy through small access openings and then locomote through a variety of environments.

**Locate and Communicate with Victims**
The robots are equipped with a camera to help locate victims, and can be outfitted with a two way speaker/microphone to enable communication with victims in a search and rescue enviornment.
