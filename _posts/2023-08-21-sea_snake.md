The **series-elastic actuated snake robot (SEA-snake)** is a modular snake robot composed of any number of modules arranged in a chain. The head typically carries a sensor package including a camera with LED lights. This robot is used for research projects on compliant control and mobility, especially in unstructured terrain or confined spaces. Its two-inch diameter profile, and ability to wrap around poles, allows it to move through both the outsides and insides of pipe networks.
